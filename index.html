            <p>Exquisite web design can not only improve the efficiency of users, but also make users more comfortable to use. I tried to follow these five basic principles in the planning of the web page.</p>
            <p>First of all, the overall page design should be centered on the screen. You can't have too much information on one side and nothing on the other. We need to make sure that the page information segments are balanced. The whole page does not have to be completely symmetrical, but the distribution of information can seriously affect the balance of the page.</p>
            <p>After that, I sorted the information on my web page into important information, navigation and text. Important information needs to be in the largest font or in a very prominent color. The navigation position must be fixed, so that users can find the navigation at any time.And navigation should be more obvious than text.Text messages use the most common design.</p>
            <p>Be careful planning when using color. Highlight important information in bright or contrasting colors.Maybe not too much emphasis on fonts (too much large text can clutter a page).Sometimes color can also make some information stand out. </p>
            <p>There should be more obvious segmentation for different modules. Navigation and text should be clearly demarcated so that users can use them more efficiently. Users will not be confused by the different modules. You can use different background colors to distinguish boundaries, or you can use dashed or solid lines to divide areas. But I prefer to use color separation.</p>
            <p>After all above, a efficient website has been created.
